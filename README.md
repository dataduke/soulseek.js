# SoulSeek.js
Made by [Guido](http://github.com/guidobouman) and [Jelle](http://github.com/jellea) at AngelHack Moscow 2013.

## Install
We're using Yeoman for our workflow:
```
> npm install -g yo grunt-cli bower
```

And install the dependencies:
```
> npm install
> bower install
```

## Development
Run the two servers in their own terminal windows:
```
> node server
> grunt server
```

Visit `http://localhost:9000/` in multiple browser tabs to get started.

## TODO
* SHA-1 worker for multipeer downloading
* Centralized socket chat with backlog
* Multiple rooms for different genres
